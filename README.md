# Bridging the Gap: From Marketing Leads to Sales Success

## Introduction

Marketing campaigns are generating leads, but not all of them convert into sales. This discrepancy raises an important question: **What factors are limiting sales conversions, and how can we optimize performance?**

To answer this, we analyzed key performance indicators (KPIs) across our sales team. The results revealed significant insights, especially in terms of win rate, quota attainment, and conversion rates.

## KPIs Analyzed

Our analysis focused on the following key metrics:

1. **Marketing Generated Leads** â€“ The total number of potential customers acquired through marketing campaigns.
2. **Win Rate** â€“ The percentage of leads successfully converted into paying customers, using 40% as our benchmark.
3. **Quota Attainment** â€“ Sales targets met by each salesperson, with 100% being the expected goal.
4. **Conversion Rate** â€“ The ratio of converted leads to total leads received.
5. **Sales by Region and Category** â€“ To understand performance variations across different markets and product categories.
